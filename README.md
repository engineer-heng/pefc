# Python Engineering Foundation Class (pefc) Library

Library to perform engineering data analysis using python.
Currently the completed module is xltab which contain classes that
tabulate data from MS Excel forms. MS Excel workbooks
typically contains data arranged in form layout used for data entry.
Such forms are useful for people but unsuitable for data analysis.
Use the classes here to tabulate data from multiple forms.
Perform analysis on the tabulated data.
